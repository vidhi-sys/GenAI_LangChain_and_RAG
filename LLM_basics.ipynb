            "* 2 eggs\n",

            "3. **Mix the dough:** Using a fork, gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs, starting from the inner rim of the well. As you mix, add water gradually, starting with 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a ball.\n",
            "4. **Knead the dough:** Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment.\n",
            "5. **Rest the dough:** Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.\n",
            "6. **Roll out the dough:** Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll out each piece into a thin sheet, using a pasta machine or a rolling pin.\n",
            "7. **Cut the noodles:** Cut the rolled-out dough into long, thin strips, using a sharp knife or a pasta cutter. You can also use a sharp blade or a pair of scissors.\n",
            "8. **Shape the noodles:** Hold the noodles vertically and gently stretch them to the desired length.\n",
            "9. **Dry the noodles:** Lay the noodles out on a clean towel or pasta drying rack to dry for at least 30 minutes.\n",

            "2. Add the noodles to the boiling water and cook for 2-5 minutes, or until they float to the surface.\n",
            "3. Drain the noodles in a colander and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.\n",
